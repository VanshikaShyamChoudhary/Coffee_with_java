# Coffee_with_java  ☕
On the way of learning ✨

🪷 Hey there!
# Welcome to my Coding world 🗺️

* It always excites me whenever I do anything have my heart in 🫀.... ✨ ✨ ✨
* It fascinates me when I apply my own logic instead seeking of others, I really don't enjoy copy-paste method, but I have tried that for sure, in beginning in 1, 2 programs.....
* BUT when I did the program with my own logic it just awoke the sleeping coder inside me.
  
* ### 🌼 Here’s the first program where I applied my own brain and felt proud:


```java
class Solution {
    public boolean arrayStringsAreEqual(String[] word1, String[] word2) {
        StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder();
        StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder();

        for (String w : word1) sb1.append(w);
        for (String w : word2) sb2.append(w);

        return sb1.toString().equals(sb2.toString());
    }
}

  ``` 
✨ This is the program that made me fall in love with Strings in Java.

🌱

🌱 Just the Beginning...

I’m excited to keep learning, building, and posting my projects here on GitHub.
Looking forward to leveling up step-by-step 📌 ✨ ✨ ✨


  ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨.....❤️
